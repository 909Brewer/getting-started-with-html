  <p><H2>REMEBER IT, WRITE IT DOWN, TAKE A PICTURE</H2>
In Lesson 1 we explored some of the basic concepts of the Web as well as HTML.
The following are my personal notes gleaned from the lecture.
</p>

<b>The Nitty Gritty of the Web</b><br>
There are four main components commonly used to describe the "web".
The most common point of access for an individual is their personal computer with a <em>web browser(1)</em>,such as Chrome or Firefox. 
Most users will communicate their request through the <em>Internet(2)</em>, which is the largest computer network, via an Internet protocol. 
The most common Internet protocol is <em>HTTP(3)</em>, which is a protocol that allows the computer to speak with <em>Servers(4)</em>. 
Servers are in essence computers which have been optimized to store and host large amounts of data which are regularly accessed.<br>

<br><br><p><b>HTML</b><br>  
<em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em> makes up the bulk of online documents. Anything can exist on the web, however HTML will be the most prolific type of document you will find.<br>
What HTML is made of: <br>
1.-- Text content (what you see on the page)<br>
2.-- Markup (what the content "looks" like)<br>
3.-- References to other documents (images, videos)<br>
4.-- Links to other pages</p>

<br><p><b>HTML Markup and Elements</b><br>

The whole markup; opening tag, content, and closing tag, is referred to as an element. A body containing "nested"
tags, or multiple tags inside of each other, is perfectly acceptable. A very simple and generic expample would be:<br>
< name> contents < /name> <br>
opening tag  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;closing tag<br><br>

Some common examples of tags would be:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;< b > - <b>bold</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;< em> - <em>emphasis</em><br><br>

<p><b>HTML ATTRIBUTES</b><br><br>
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements such as defining an image, or establishing a link.
This is typically written as a tag, then attribute, value of the attribute, "contents", then the closing tag as seen below.<br>
< tag attr="value"> contents < /tag><br><br>
A common example of a "tag" would be the <em>Anchor</em> (which establishes a link) - < a> <br>
< a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;href=&nbsp;&nbsp;"www.reddit.com">Shamlessplug< /a><br>

Anchor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attribute &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Value &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contents&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closing anchor <br>
<br>
A second example is the Image tag ------- < img><br>
< img&nbsp;&nbsp src&nbsp;&nbsp=&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp"url"&nbsp;&nbsp alt="text"><br>
Tag &nbsp;&nbsp Source &nbsp;&nbspURL &nbsp;&nbsp alt (which stands for alternate) "text displayed if image doesn't load"<br>
<br>Since images don't have any contents they are considered a "void tag", and thus don't have a closing tag.

<p><b>Whitespace</b></p>

An interesting fact about HTML is that the computer does not recognize "space" in it's traditional role.
No matter how many "spaces" an individual may type into a line, the computer only codes it as 1 gap until the next character.
Some common ways to reflect spacing, or dropping down to a new line include the break, and paragraph tags. There are essentially two forms of formatting, <em>inline,</em> and<em> block</em>.
The easiest way I found to remember this is that The block examples are structural elements, while the inline elements are text-based. <br><br>
<b>< br></b> - break gives you whitespace so lines don't run on together, since the break tag has no content, it is a void tag.
It is considered an inline tag as it is text based and not structural. <br>

<b>< p> </b>- paragraph is for block style of creating white space, and you can adjust height and width etc. Since there is content
to block style, there are closing tags.</p>

<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723438">This link</a> will demonstrate a deeper understanding than I have of <em>Inline vs. Block</em> formatting.
<br><p><b>Various Gem's and Tidbits Worth Remembering</b></p>

Computers are "stupid", though they can preform amazing feats of calculation, they only do so
because they were told to by the program written for them.
In general, any time you get frustrated you need to remeber that it is behaving the way it is
simply because you told it to behave that way!<br><br>

A programming language is just that, a language. There is no prerequisite to learning how to speak, and there are
no prerequisites to learn how to write. Remember that things come in time, and remembering the smallest details
are not always important. What is crucial to success however, is knowing where to find those details when you need to.
